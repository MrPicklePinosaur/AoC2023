## Writeups

## Day1

I have only had very minor exposure to programming in Zig, and was excited to
learn the language a lot better this year. Some immediate things that stood out
to me was how much was checked by the compiler. It feels like a mini-rust of
sorts. The optional and error types are also highly appreciated. Some slight
annoyances with the langauge include unsued variables being a compile error and
the slightly wacky loops.

In part b, I also discovered that the sentinel value of a pointer or slice is
also included in the type, which I found pretty neat. The saturating
subtracting operator is also some nice sugar.
